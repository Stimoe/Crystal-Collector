Crystal Collector

This project was about working on randomly generating numbers and addition combined with updating the doms.
This project also illustrates how to reset the game without reloading the page to maintain the wincount.

If anyone is interested they can run the index html and check out the code.

Any questions can be sent to me Thomas Stimac, on my porfolio page, at https://stimoe.github.io/Thomas-Portfolio-Page/ This was solely produced by myself, Thomas Stimac
